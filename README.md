# Temperature-Converter

This project is a simple Python program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The program defines a function convert_temperature(temp, unit) that accepts two inputs: the temperature value and its unit (F for Fahrenheit, C for Celsius).

The result is rounded to two decimal places using the round() function. 

Conditional statements are used to determine the correct formula, and .upper() ensures that both uppercase and lowercase unit inputs are handled.

The program also includes a user interface where the user is prompted to enter the temperature and unit.

The converted temperature is then displayed on the screen.
